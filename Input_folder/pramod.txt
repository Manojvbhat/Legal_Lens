After reviewing the arguments and considering the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the court finds that both Mr. Prabhakar and Mr. Pramod are entitled to an equal share of their father's property.
The court acknowledges Mr. Prabhakar's significant contribution to maintaining and enhancing the farmland over the past 20 years. However, this contribution does not negate Mr. Pramod's legal right to an equal share of the inheritance. The principles of equity and fairness, as enshrined in the Hindu Succession Act, must be upheld.
The court hereby orders that the 5 acres of farmland be divided equally between Mr. Prabhakar and Mr. Pramod. Additionally, Mr. Prabhakar will retain the house near the farmland. In consideration of this arrangement, Mr. Prabhakar is ordered to pay Mr. Pramod a sum of 10 lakhs as compensation, reflecting the market value of the house and recognizing the additional contributions made by Mr. Prabhakar to the farmland.
This judgment ensures a fair and equitable distribution of the property, honoring both the legal rights and individual contributions of the parties involved.
