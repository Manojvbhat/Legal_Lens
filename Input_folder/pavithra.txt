After considering the arguments presented by both counsels, the court finds in favor of Mrs. Pavithra. The provisions under Section 24 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and Section 125 of the Indian Penal Code mandate that a spouse and children should receive adequate support to maintain their standard of living post-divorce. The court hereby orders Mr. Nagabhushan to provide monthly
maintenance of 25,000 INR for Mrs. Pavithra and 20,000 INR for their son. This decision ensures continuous financial support, aligning with the welfare and future needs of the child, as mandated under Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The proposed lump sum payment is deemed insufficient to cover the long-term needs and potential contingencies that may arise. The court emphasizes that this judgment is in the best interest of both parties, ensuring a fair and just resolution. The maintenance will continue until further orders or until circumstances significantly change.
