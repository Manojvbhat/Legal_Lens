P. Narayana Moorthy: "Your Honor, my client, Mrs. Pavithra, has endured significant emotional and financial hardship throughout her marriage to Mr. Nagabhushan. Despite holding a master's degree in computer science, she has dedicated herself entirely to maintaining the household and caring for their young son. Under Section 125 of the Indian Penal Code, my client is entitled to maintenance to support herself and her child.

Mr. Nagabhushan earns a substantial income of 25 lakhs per annum, yet he proposes a one-time payment of 20 lakhs to settle all claims. This is both inadequate and unjust. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, specifically under Section 24 and 25, provides for the maintenance and support of a spouse during and after divorce. Considering Mr. Nagabhushan's substantial earnings, a monthly maintenance of 25,000 INR for my client and 20,000 INR for their son is reasonable and necessary for their sustenance.

Furthermore, the one-time payment does not consider the future educational and medical expenses of their son, nor does it account for the inflation and rising cost of living. The amount proposed by Mr. Nagabhushan is an attempt to evade his continuous responsibility towards his family."

Narashimha Rao (representing Nagabhushan):
Narashimha Rao: "Your Honor, while we acknowledge Mrs. Pavithra's contributions to the household, we must also consider the financial prudence of Mr. Nagabhushan's proposal. A lump sum payment of 20 lakhs ensures that Mrs. Pavithra has immediate access to a significant amount of money, which she can invest wisely for her and her son's future.

The demand for 25,000 INR per month for herself and 20,000 INR per month for their son amounts to 45,000 INR per month, which is excessive given that Mr. Nagabhushan already bears substantial financial responsibilities. Moreover, under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the court has the discretion to grant a gross sum or monthly payments as deemed fit. The lump sum payment proposed is more than sufficient for Mrs. Pavithra to re-establish herself professionally and provide for her son.

Additionally, Your Honor, the payment structure suggested by Mrs. Pavithra could impose undue financial strain on Mr. Nagabhushan, potentially affecting his professional performance and future earning capacity. We believe that the one-time payment is a fair and practical solution that allows both parties to move forward independently."

P. Narayana Moorthy:
P. Narayana Moorthy: "Your Honor, the proposed lump sum payment of 20 lakhs is insufficient when viewed in the context of Mr. Nagabhushan's annual income and the lifestyle to which Mrs. Pavithra and their son are accustomed. The maintenance amount we are seeking is a small fraction of Mr. Nagabhushan's yearly earnings, ensuring that Mrs. Pavithra and her son can maintain a reasonable standard of living without undue hardship.

The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, under Section 25, empowers the court to ensure that the spouse seeking maintenance is not left destitute. Furthermore, Section 26 of the same Act mandates the welfare of minor children, including their education and living expenses. By providing monthly maintenance, we can ensure that the child's needs are continuously met, and Mrs. Pavithra is not left financially vulnerable."

Narashimha Rao:
Narashimha Rao: "Your Honor, while we respect the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, it is also crucial to recognize that the lump sum payment offers finality and avoids continuous litigation over maintenance adjustments. This approach provides a clear-cut resolution and allows both parties to achieve financial independence without ongoing entanglements.

Mr. Nagabhushan has made a reasonable offer considering his current financial commitments and the future uncertainties. The one-time payment of 20 lakhs is a substantial amount that Mrs. Pavithra can utilize to secure a stable future for herself and their son."

P. Narayana Moorthy:
P. Narayana Moorthy: "Your Honor, the long-term financial security of Mrs. Pavithra and their son cannot be guaranteed through a one-time payment. The monthly maintenance we are requesting is not excessive but rather a necessary amount to cover basic living expenses, education, and unforeseen medical costs. This arrangement also aligns with the principles enshrined in the Indian Constitution, ensuring social justice and equality.

Furthermore, continuous support ensures that Mr. Nagabhushan fulfills his responsibilities as a father and husband, as stipulated by Section 125 of the Indian Penal Code and the Hindu Marriage Act. It is imperative that the court prioritizes the sustained welfare of Mrs. Pavithra and her son over a one-time financial settlement."
